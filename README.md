# NotAWebsite brute force used wordlists/words
A central repo for all of the wordlists that have already been bruteforced and scripts that help with the process.
Included (will) be a script that processes a new wordlist and removes the entries that have already been tried in the wordlists/ folder. 

## How do I brute force the website with my wordlist?
- Use the wordlist checker tool to remove any tested words (Currently not ready yet!)
- Run the bruteforcer ( Repo here: https://github.com/eetnaviation/notawebsite-bruteforce )

## If you are using your own bruteforce script
- Ensure you are hitting the endpoint for https://haykam.com/notawebsite/ on every 200 response, this helps us track valid codes together.
